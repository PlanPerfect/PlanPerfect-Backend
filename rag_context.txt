# INTERIOR DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND BEST PRACTICES

### BALANCE

Achieve visual equilibrium in a room using **symmetry** (mirrored layouts), **asymmetry** (different items balanced by color, size, or shape), or **radial balance** (elements radiate around a central point) [1].

### RHYTHM

Guide the eye through the space by repeating colors, textures, or patterns at regular intervals. Examples: repeating an accent color in cushions and artwork or using repeating geometric motifs in furniture [2].

### HARMONY / UNITY

Ensure all elements (colors, textures, furnishings) feel cohesive. Use complementary finishes and a consistent palette so the design feels “of a piece” [3].

### EMPHASIS (FOCAL POINT)

Provide a clear focal point in every room, such as a statement sofa, artwork, or feature wall. Other elements should support this without competing for attention [4].

### PROPORTION AND SCALE

Furnish according to room size. Avoid oversized furniture in small rooms; larger rooms can handle bigger pieces. The Golden Ratio can help objects relate harmoniously [5].

### FUNCTIONALITY AND FLOW

Plan layouts for practical use. Leave clear pathways between furniture, keep frequently used items accessible, and allow modular arrangements for flexibility [6].

# COLOR THEORY

### BASICS

Use the color wheel: primary (red, blue, yellow), secondary (green, orange, purple), and tertiary colors. Apply the 60-30-10 rule: 60% dominant (walls, floor), 30% secondary (furniture), 10% accent (decor) [7].

### WARM VS COOL

Warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) energize; cool colors (blues, greens, purples) calm and make spaces feel larger. In tropical climates like Singapore, cool neutrals can make small rooms airy, while warm accents add vibrancy [8].

### COLOR SCHEMES

* **Complementary:** Opposite on the wheel (e.g., blue/orange) for contrast.
* **Analogous:** Neighbors on the wheel (e.g., blue, teal, green) for harmony.
* **Monochromatic:** Shades/tints of one hue for a cohesive, elegant look [9].

# ROOM-SPECIFIC DESIGN TIPS

### LIVING ROOM

Flexible seating layouts (modular sofas, cluster armchairs), concealed electronics, rugs to define zones, layered lighting, and clear walkways. Suitable for open-plan HDBs or condos [10].

### BEDROOM

Calm colors, maximize natural light, mirrors for spaciousness, multifunctional furniture (beds with drawers, built-in wardrobes), and soft lighting. Keep furniture proportional to room size [11].

### KITCHEN

Efficient layouts: galley, L-shaped, U-shaped, or island/peninsula. Ceiling-high cabinets, corner pull-outs, light-colored cabinetry, and reflective surfaces maximize space. Appliances should fit household size [12].

### BATHROOM / WASHROOM

Use light colors, frameless mirrors, corner or walk-in showers, wall-mounted sinks, and vertical storage. Ensure proper ventilation for tropical climates [13].

### DINING / COMMON AREA

Flow with living space, matching finishes, pendant lighting over dining table, appropriately sized tables, stackable chairs, and subtle partitions for open layouts [14].

# FURNITURE COMPATIBILITY AND STYLING

* Coordinate color and material: unify with a common wood tone or finish.
* Mixing styles: transitional pieces bridge different styles; maintain cohesion with repeated motifs.
* Textures: layer fabrics (velvet, woven, leather, metal) for depth.
* Scale: match furniture size to room; low-profile furniture in small spaces, statement pieces in large rooms [15].
