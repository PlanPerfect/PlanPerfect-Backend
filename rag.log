Response:
In the context of interior design, Japan refers to a style that emphasizes Zen simplicity, with uncluttered and multifunctional spaces. This style often incorporates natural materials like bamboo and cypress, and features an earthy neutral palette. The Japanese style also values a connection to nature and light, often maximizing daylight in the space. There's also a design movement called Japandi, which blends Japanese minimalism with Scandinavian warmth.
